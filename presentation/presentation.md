# Better with Friends

^ Elm very cool on its own. But its better with friends.

# Big Picture
![](graphics/big-picture.jpeg)

^ So I wanted to make a big-picture presentation, one that would not just explain Elm as a language, but demonstrate how it fits into an existing ecosystem of tools.

# The Scenario

^ In order to do this, let's pretend that we're a small consultancy and a friend of ours has just
approached us with a new project.

---

# The Scenario (Notation)

To play a note, the user types:

```
- A letter, optionally followed by a `+` (for a sharp), or a `-` (for a flat)
  or the _ character, to indicate a rest
- Optionally a letter defining the length of the note. If unspecified, "s" will be assumed.
  - t = 32nd note
  - s = 16th note
  - e = 8th note
  - q = Quarter note
  - h = Half note
  - w = Whole note
- Optionally a number, 0-8, defining the octave in which the note should be played, the default
  being 3
```

^ She has come up with a compact musical notation that will fit a good chunk of music into 140
characters, and she wants us to teach the browser to play the music encoded in that notation.
But thatâ€™s not all. Her vision includes a client that streams in tweets, parsing them and queueing
them up to be played as they happen, ultimately allowing users to listen to a never-ending piece
of real-time music, composed by a symphony of twitter users world-wide.

# The Scenario (Notation)

B-s2 (Low B flat 16th note)

Broken up:

B               -      s                                           2
^ The "b" note  ^flat  ^ hold for the length of a sixteenth note   ^ play in the second octave
